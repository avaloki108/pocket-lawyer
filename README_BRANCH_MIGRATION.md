# Branch Migration: What I've Done and What You Need to Do

## üìù Task: Make branch master the default branch and delete main

## ‚úÖ What I've Accomplished

I've prepared your repository for the branch migration by:

1. **Verified Repository Status**
   - ‚úÖ Searched all configuration files (.json, .yml, .yaml, .sh, etc.)
   - ‚úÖ Confirmed NO hardcoded references to 'main' branch
   - ‚úÖ Verified Android app configs have no branch dependencies
   - ‚úÖ Confirmed no CI/CD workflows that need updating

2. **Created Migration Documentation**
   - ‚úÖ `BRANCH_MIGRATION.md` - Comprehensive 154-line guide with:
     - Multiple migration methods (Web UI, GitHub CLI, API)
     - Step-by-step instructions
     - Verification procedures
     - Rollback instructions
     - Post-migration checklist
   
   - ‚úÖ `QUICK_BRANCH_MIGRATION.md` - Quick reference for fast execution

3. **Verified Safety**
   - ‚úÖ Repository is safe to migrate
   - ‚úÖ No code changes needed
   - ‚úÖ No configuration updates required

## üöß What You Need to Do (Manual Steps Required)

Due to GitHub security and environment limitations, I **cannot** directly:
- Change the default branch in GitHub repository settings
- Delete remote branches
- Access GitHub API with repository admin permissions

### You must complete these steps:

#### Quick Method (Recommended):
```bash
# 1. Create master from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b master
git push origin master

# 2. Change default via GitHub CLI
gh repo edit avaloki108/pocket-lawyer --default-branch master

# 3. Delete main
git push origin --delete main
```

#### Detailed Method:
See `QUICK_BRANCH_MIGRATION.md` or `BRANCH_MIGRATION.md` for complete instructions.

## üéØ Why This Approach?

From my sandboxed environment, I cannot:
- Authenticate with GitHub to change repository settings
- Push to main/master branches directly
- Use GitHub API to modify repository configuration
- Delete remote branches

However, I **can** and **have**:
- Verified your repository is ready for migration
- Created comprehensive documentation
- Confirmed no code changes are needed

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time to Complete

- **5 minutes** if using GitHub CLI
- **10 minutes** if using GitHub web interface

## üìö Files Created

1. `BRANCH_MIGRATION.md` - Full migration guide
2. `QUICK_BRANCH_MIGRATION.md` - Quick reference
3. `README_BRANCH_MIGRATION.md` - This file

## üîó Next Steps

1. Review `QUICK_BRANCH_MIGRATION.md`
2. Follow the 4-step process
3. Verify with: `gh repo view avaloki108/pocket-lawyer --json defaultBranchRef`
4. You're done! üéâ
